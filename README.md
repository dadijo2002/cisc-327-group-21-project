**SCRUM MEETS**

*A6 scrum meet*

Makayla

Branch: booking_backend

Progress: finished first draft of  backend booking system

Difficulties: finding a way to make sure there is no overlapping bookings 

Plan for completing:contact a TA and keep searching for online resources to help

Yash

Branch: Booking_Frontend

Progress: Completed the frontend, made two different copies of the booking page so we can try both out to see what works best. I have also pushed the changes to
dockerhub, so it can be built into an image for hosting!

Difficulties: Understanding how to maintain a docker image and host it on my desktop

Plan for completing: Contact a ta for help. I will also further my online research into docker. 

Daniel

Branch: a6-backend-tests

Progress: Completed backend testing, need review from everyone else to see if I forgot anything

Difficulties: thinking about how to test a listing that isn’t made by the user but I think I figured it out

Plan for completing: already complete :) just awaiting review

Aniket

Branch: booking_security_integration_testing

Progress: in progress

Difficulties: Which function do I choose for SQLi testing? Which html file should I do integration testing for

Plan for completing: I will likely try to do integration testing on both html files so that we cover both bases. As for SQLi testing, I will likely choose the book_listings function




A5 scrum meet 
Makayla

Branch: SQLi_register 

Progress: first test case done 

Difficulties: when to open and close file so that the test cases can be used in the best way

Plan for completing: confer with teammate on listing sql injection testing about when to open file and finish the rest of the test cases.


Yash

Branch: Docker
Progress: added required docker files, and have successfully pushed to docker hub

Difficulties: figuring out how to use docker commands, but i figured it out anyways from some intuition 

Plan for completing making sure i talk with group members and ta’s about docker tips.


Daniel

Branch: a5_fixes

Progress: attempting to scope out bugs and beginning to find ways to fix

Difficulties: other workload/the complicatedness of all the files/tests, trying to understand functionality so I can at the bare minimum get our tests running instead of errors, computer still uncooperative

Plan for completing:Starting soon will push to GitHub and try to work through some of the changes gradually, hopefully get tests running and ideally get them all accepted

Aniket

Branch: SQLi_listings_creation

Progress: Completed, added test cases that injected sql queries into the parameters of a function

Difficulties: Wasn’t exactly too sure as to what the assignment asked of us, but I managed to figure it out through the power of reading comprehension 

Plan for completing: Maybe getting a bit more insight into SQLI attacks could prove useful for next sprint


Assignment 4 scrum meeting team updates 

Makayla

Branch: registration_testing

Progress: 3 test cases- registration works, password not empty, email not empty

Difficulties: unexplained import unresolved errors that make it so I can’t run the program 

Plan for completing: Continue to look for answers to problems online, and ask ta if i can’t find the error. Also continue to write test cases 

Daniel

Branch: test_index

Progress: test cases for index: page loads correctly

  test cases for listing update: valid and invalid input
      
Difficulties: my computer is still not letting me run anything so I need someone else to please help me out here

Plan for completing: upload scrum board image with test cases tomorrow

Aniket

Branch: test_login

Progress: Successful login page loading, test empty password or email 

Difficulties: Can’t run the program due to an Integrity error? How do I fix this?

Plan for completing: make test cases, as well as their black box equivalents

Yash

Branch: listings_creation_profile_tests

Progress: Working through test cases for valid/invalid input

Difficulties: been sick this week; hard to focus

Plan for completing: make more test cases
